      President Trump's proposed executive action for a #2020Census citizenship question will be illegal, unconstitutional, and un-American. Everyone in the country should be pushing back against it. Walk with me briefly as I unpack this... https://t.co/PLaambiNeD

      We can’t afford for the media to divide the Democratic Party. @AOC  @SpeakerPelosi please keep your differences on the DL. The media will use any disagreements to further divide and next thing you know Trump is back in office and God help us. #teamAOC #Palante #BX

      Wait. Trump literally thought that Pete Buttigieg had a Twitter handle based on the sophomoric nickname Trump himself gave him? https://t.co/JNWuGPihmi

Megan Rapinoe: WE DID IT! I deserve this. 

GOP: What happened to humility? So rude and un-American.
